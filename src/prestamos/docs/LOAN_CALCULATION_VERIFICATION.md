## Verification Points

### 1. Payment Calculation

- PMT formula correctly calculates fixed monthly payment
- Rounding to 2 decimal places works properly
- Final payment adjusts to clear remaining balance exactly

### 2. Interest Calculation

- Interest calculated on remaining balance each period
- Interest portion decreases over time
- Principal portion increases over time
- Total interest charged is fair and accurate

### 3. Balance Tracking

- Remaining balance decreases correctly
- Final balance reaches exactly zero
- No rounding errors accumulate

### 4. Capital Movement

- Initial loan amount properly recorded
- Each payment properly tracked
- Capital increases/decreases reflect correctly

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Precision Handling

- Use DOUBLE PRECISION for calculations
- Round to 2 decimal places for display/storage
- Handle final payment separately to clear balance

### 2. Payment Processing

- Calculate interest first
- Determine principal portion
- Update remaining balance
- Record payment
- Update capital movements

### 3. Verification Steps

- Verify payment pattern matches loan type
- Ensure capital consistency
- Validate interest calculations
- Check final balance is zero

## Safe Implementation Strategy

1. Calculate all values before making any changes
2. Use transactions for payment processing
3. Verify results before committing
4. Keep audit trail of all movements
5. Handle edge cases explicitly

## Edge Cases to Consider

1. Early payments
2. Partial payments
3. Payment rounding
4. Interest rate changes
5. Term modifications

## Validation Rules

1. Total paid must exceed principal for interest-bearing loans
2. Remaining balance must reach exactly zero
3. Payment count must match term
4. Capital movements must balance

This verification confirms the loan calculation logic is sound and can be safely used as the basis for prestamos improvements.
